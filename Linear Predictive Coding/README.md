This is the code of the paper [Lateral predictive coding revisited: Internal model, symmetry breaking, and response time](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1572-9494/ac7c03). The code is written in python and one can open the file using jupyter notebook. To run the code, one shoule first install pytorch and other basic python packages. 
By running the file _TrainingProcess.ipynb_, one can obtain the weights through SGD. And  running the file _dataanalysis.ipynb_ can give the results in the papers.
